# IDE

## ATOM

#### Advantages:													

- First of all, it's FREE!																			
- I like it's theme
- Kirby-snippits! no need of a cheatsheet.

#### Disadvantage:

- It's a browser-based app so it's a bit slower than other apps
- It can be intensive for older processors
- Tabs can be a bit "iffy"

## Visual Studio Code 

#### Advantages:													

- Extendable through plug-ins																					
- Updated frequently
- Integrated debugging 

#### Disadvantage:

- Bad auto import
- Slow launch time
- File search is extremely slow

## Brackets

### Advantages:													

- Brackets will automatically refresh the browser and load the latest saved version of a file open in the browser. ​																							
- Brackets is free and open source.
- Brackets will fill in the tags when typing.

#### Disadvantage:

- They command to use another text editor for PHP developers.
- No collaborative editing 
- The official extension registry is sort of confusing. All the folders and files are in one big list without any filtering options or categories. 

## Atom

I started using Atom, and have no complex knowledge about any other IDE. Atom feels comfortable and seems to do whatever I like it to do.
